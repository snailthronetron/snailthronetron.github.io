            SnailThrone is a King of the Hill game: your goal is to climb to the
            top of the pyramid, and stay there long enough without anyone
            booting you off the throne. </p>
                    <p>
            To claim the throne, you must sacrifice snails. Snails can be
            bought, hatched, and sold back to the game itself. </p>
                    <p>
            In practical terms, SnailThrone is a smart contract running on the
            TRONeum blockchain. You must have MetaMask or a compatible TRONeum
            wallet to play. </p>

                    <p>
            TRONeum is a decentralized network where programs can run
            autonomously. SnailThrone is one such program. Nobody owns the game,
            and thousands of computers all over the world execute the game's
            programming as part of the TRONeum network. </p>
                    <p>
            You may also know TRONeum as a cryptocurrency. The currency of the
            TRONeum network is called TRON, or TRON. TRON is used to pay for
            transactions, as well as exchanges of value. </p>
                    <p>
            SnailThrone requires TRON for both transactions and exchanges of
            value. </p>

                <p><b>HOW DOES SNAILTHRONE WORK?</b></p>
                <div class="infobox">
                    <p>
            SnailThrone is a deterministic game. There is no randomness to the
            rules. Your actions have fixed outcomes, and the same goes for every
            player. </p>
                    <p>
            To start, you will need to buy snails. Once you own a few snails, a
            variety of actions is available to you. </p>
                    <p>
            You can sacrifice some of your snails to claim the throne as the
            Pharaoh. If no other player is willing to sacrifice enough snails
            until the timer is over, you win this round's jackpot. </p>
                    <p>
            Your snails lay eggs consistently. You can hatch these eggs into
            even more snails, or you can feed these eggs to the FrogKing to get
            some TRON back. </p>
                    <p>
            At any point in the game, you can sell your snails back to the game.
            The TRON you will get for this action may be higher or lower than
            the TRON you spent to buy your snails, based on several factors
            expanded below. </p>
                    <p>
            Last but not least, holding snails entitles you to a share of the
            TRON spent on buying or hatching snails. </p>
                    <p>
            As long as you have snails, you will passively get TRON for as long
            as other players participate. </p>

                <p><b>IS THE GAME SECURE?</b></p>
                <div class="infobox">
                    <p>
            Smart contracts act exactly as defined, and the source code is open
            for anyone to read. </p>
                    <p>
            The game lives on the TRONeum blockchain and would go on without
            interruption even if the website went down. </p>
                    <p>
            The TRONeum blockchain itself is secured by hundreds of millions of
            dollars worth of redundancy. Your bank is less secure than this! </p>
                    <p>
            The biggest risks with decentralized applications have to do with
            *your own* security. </p>
                    <p>
            Transactions are irreversible, and nobody can refund you if you're
            not happy with your purchase. </p>
                    <p>
            Make sure you write your private key down. Keep it safe, and don't
            share it with anyone else. </p>

                <p><b>IS THIS AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE?</b></p>
                <div class="infobox">
                    <p>
            No! This is a zero-sum game, meaning each participant's gains are
            balanced by another participant's losses. </p>
                    <p>
            SnailThrone is a game of math and logic, with no randomness
            involved. The correct strategy will lead to success, and there can
            be many winners. But there will be many losers as well. </p>
                    <p>
            Even though SnailThrone isn't gambling, you shouldn't play this game
            if you're susceptible to gambling addiction. </p>
                    <p>
            Make sure you familiarize yourself with the rules, and don't play
            with TRON you can't afford to lose. If you want to try out the game
            in a safe environment, head over to the TEST version on the Ropsten
            network, where TRON is free. </p>

                <p>BUY and SELL snails (pyramid tokens) directly from the contract.</p>
                <p>
          Snail holders receive proportional DIVIDENDS from buys and hatches, as
          well as from other Snail games (in the future). </p>
                <p>
          Token price correlates with snail max supply. More snails = higher
          price. </p>
                <p>
          Snails produce EGGS, at a rate of 8% per day. A hatchery can hold as
          many eggs as there are snails. </p>
                <p>
          Players can HATCH these eggs to turn them into more snails. Hatching
          still costs TRON, but only half of the normal price. </p>
                <p>
          Players can also FEED their eggs to the FrogKing for an TRON reward. </p>
                <p>
          Players can SACRIFICE a certain amount of snails to hold the title of
          Pharaoh. The Pharaoh earns dividends on every buy, and if the timer
          runs out, the Pharaoh can claim the GodPot. </p>
                <p>
          NOTE: buying more snails will reset your eggs to 0, and selling or
          making a sacrifice will reduce your number of eggs. Make sure to hatch
          or feed before any other action if you have a significant number of
          eggs! </p>

                <p>Snails can be sold to the SnailPot for TRON.</p>

          Every 12 seconds, one snail is removed from the required sacrifice.
          The minimum required is 40 snails. </p>
                <p>
          A successful sacrifice will bump the timer back up by 8 minutes, and

          Once the timer hits 0, whoever holds the Pharaoh title ascends to
